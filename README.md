# Blythonexport
A python script to export A 3DRT blender rigged animations to an ascii file.
At the time of development, this script was used on the following commerically available model:
https://3drt.com/store/characters/us-army-marines.html

This script has no interface in blender, these are the GENERAL steps to use it
1)Load your model
2)Select your model
3)Load the script
(Optional) You will probably need to modify the script in a couple of places
  -change the export directory specified in "main_path"
  -change the export filename specified in the "outputfile"
  -change the frames to export..this is the python "frame" variable
4) Run the script
5) Figure out what to do with the file...this video shows what I do with the file
